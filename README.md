# 📄 PaperPilot AI

### AI-Powered Research Paper Summarizer and Academic Assistant

PaperPilot AI helps students, researchers, and professors understand research papers fast. Upload a PDF and get executive/standard/detailed summaries, a simplified explanation, key contributions, research gaps, future scope, a full methodology breakdown, keywords, flashcards, viva questions, a ready-made PPT outline, citations in 4 formats, a difficulty score, a RAG-based chat interface, and multi-paper comparison — all exportable to PDF, DOCX, PPTX, Markdown, or TXT.

Every AI feature runs **100% locally** on free, open-source models. No OpenAI/Gemini/Claude/Azure API key is required, and no paid service is called at any point.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- ~4 GB free disk space (for downloaded model weights, cached after first run)

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

cp .env.example .env            # edit SECRET_KEY etc. if needed

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The first request that touches the AI pipeline (uploading a paper) will
download the summarization/embedding/QA models from the Hugging Face Hub
(a few hundred MB total). This happens once — after that, everything runs
fully offline from the local cache.

Backend runs at: **http://localhost:8000** (Swagger docs at `/docs`)

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at: **http://localhost:5173**

---

## Running with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8000

> Note: the backend Docker image pre-downloads the spaCy model at build
> time; the Transformer/embedding models are still downloaded on first use
> and cached in the `backend/data` volume mount.

---

## Usage

1. Open the frontend, click **Get Started**, and register an account.
2. Go to **Upload**, drag in one or more PDF research papers.
3. Papers are analyzed in the background — poll status on the **History**
   page or open the paper directly to watch it complete.
4. Once analyzed, open a paper to see all tabs: Summaries, Simplified
   Explanation, Contributions, Gaps, Methodology, Keywords, Flashcards,
   Viva Questions, Citations, and PPT Outline.
5. Use **Export** on the paper page to download PDF / DOCX / PPTX / MD / TXT.
6. Open **Chat** on a paper to ask questions answered only from that paper.
7. Use **Compare** to select 2–5 analyzed papers and see a side-by-side
   comparison table plus shared objective terms.

## Troubleshooting

**"No extractable text found in this PDF"**
The PDF is likely a scanned image without a text layer. PaperPilot AI does
not include OCR by default; add an OCR pre-processing step (e.g. Tesseract)
if you need to support scanned papers.

**First upload takes a long time**
The first analysis run downloads several hundred MB of model weights from
Hugging Face. Subsequent runs use the local cache and are much faster.

**`spacy.load` fails / "model not found"**
Run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` inside your virtual
environment. The app falls back to a blank pipeline (with reduced NLP
quality) if this step is skipped, so it still runs — but results will be
better with the full model installed.

**Out of memory when loading models**
`facebook/bart-large-cnn` and the QA model both need noticeable RAM
(1.5–3 GB combined). On constrained machines, swap `SUMMARIZATION_MODEL` in
`.env` to a lighter model, e.g. `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6`.

**CORS errors in the browser console**
Make sure `FRONTEND_ORIGINS` in the backend `.env` includes the exact
origin your frontend is served from (e.g. `http://localhost:5173`).

**FAISS index seems stale after re-analyzing a paper**
Deleting a paper also deletes its FAISS index; re-analyzing does not
currently rebuild it automatically (the RAG index is built lazily on the
first chat question after re-analysis using the updated `raw_text`).

---

## Future Scope

- OCR support for scanned PDFs (Tesseract / EasyOCR)
- Background task queue (Celery + Redis) instead of FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`
  for better horizontal scaling
- Multi-user workspace / paper sharing
- Fine-tuned, domain-specific summarization models (CS vs. Biology vs. Physics)
- Browser extension to summarize a paper directly from arXiv/IEEE Xplore
